## climate_PCA_garden_provenance_historic_future.Rmd

PCA of climate data for both provenance sites (including historic and future climates) and garden sites (yearly climates from 2020-2023).

input: data/clean/546_genotypes_provenance_future_historic_climate_with_gardens_long_format.Rda

output: Figure 2B and C

## transfer_function_multiyear_linear_mixed_effects_model.Rmd

Test the effects of home climate, garden climate, and genetics on the growth and mortality responses of hybrid poplars across different common gardens, then predict genotype-specific reaction norms to MCMT. Uses glmmTMB to fit a zero-inflated mixed-effects model.

input: mini_garden_phenotypic_and_climate_data_2021-2024.Rdata

output:

* Figure 4

## predict_maxi_garden_phenotypes.Rmd

Test whether model built from mini gardens dataset can accurately predict growth in the maxi gardens (3 sites, one of which is novel, and 544 genotypes, 500 of which are novel)

This code is mostly pulled from 'code/transfer_function_multiyear_linear_mixed_effects_model.Rmd' script

input:

* results/model_prediction/glmTMB_multiyear_model_outputs_garden_MCMT_2021-2022_vs_GrowthIncrement_2021-2022.Rda

output: Figure 3

## predict_growth_future_climates.Rmd

Using the genotype-specific modeled reaction norms produced by 'transfer_function_multiyear_linear_mixed_effects_model.Rmd' script, predict how each genotype's growth and survival could change under future temperatures (represented by MCMT).

input:

* results/model_prediction/glmTMB_multiyear_model_outputs_garden_MCMT_2021-2022_vs_GrowthIncrement_2021-2022.Rda

* results/model_prediction/predictedGrowth_acrossClimates_byGenotype_garden_MCMT_2021-2022.Rdata

output: Figure S11


## map_best_genotype_by_climate.Rmd

Using reaction norms modeled in the 'transfer_function_multiyear_linear_mixed_effects_model.Rmd' script, identify the genotype having highest growth (taking into account mortality probability) across the sampled hybrid zone under historic and future values of MCMT. Maps show where the 'optimal' genotype/species ancestry could shift spatially under future temperatures, resulting in spatial shifts in the location of the hybrid zone.

input:

output:

* Figure 6
